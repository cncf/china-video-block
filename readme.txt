ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ðŸŽ¬ ðŸ§± Automatically serves China-hosted videos to Chinese audiences while delivering YouTube videos to viewers from other regions.

== Description ==

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ðŸŽ¬ ðŸ§± This block allows for embedding a video in a WordPress post or page.  If the user who views the page is in China, a different video will show from users in the rest of the world.  This is to appropriately deal with China's Internet wall which blocks YouTube and other video platforms.

The plugin has been developed for [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) and [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

For more information on how to develop this block, please see the [github repo](https://github.com/cncf/china-video-block). PRs are welcome.
